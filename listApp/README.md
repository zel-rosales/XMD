## Design & Purpose

**MyTinerary** is a list-based app designed for travelers to plan and organize their upcoming trips. It allows users to create a personalized itinerary of activities they want to experience at their destination. Ideal for planners and list-lovers, MyTinerary helps users stay on track during their travels and ensures they don't miss out on anything they’ve planned!

## Basic Use

Users can build their itinerary by adding and deleting items, marking items as complete, or restarting with a blank list.
The app starts with an empty itinerary.
