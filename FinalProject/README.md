## Design & Purpose

**Bias Binder** is a themed photo gallery app designed specifically for K-pop fans who collect photocards. The app allows users to digitally organize, track, and showcase their photocard collections in a structured and visually engaging way. Inspired by the concept of physical binders, Bias Binder helps collectors keep track of their collection by displaying each photocard with further details about its origin and set if applicable.

The app’s target audience includes K-pop enthusiasts—especially photocard collectors—who want a simple, mobile-friendly solution to catalog their items, manage wishlists, and visualize their collecting goals on the go. The app combines the functionality of a gallery viewer with features tailored to fandom-based collecting habits.

This project is an expansion of the initial Bias Binder app I created for Assignment 3. New features include:
